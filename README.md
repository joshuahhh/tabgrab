tabgrab
=======

It is very nice to have quick offline access to guitar tabs. I wrote these scripts toward that aim.

* dylan.py -- Bob Dylan, from http://dylanchords.info/
* igt.py -- assorted artists, from http://www.indieguitartabs.com/
* mg.py -- The Mountain Goats, from http://themountaingoats.net/wiki/doku.php?id=tabs:home
* tmbg.py -- The Mountain Goats, from http://tmbw.net/
* ultimate.py -- cleans up HTML files downloaded from http://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/
